# AZD Foundry Extension Bug Bash

> **Unsigned local test builds — not official releases.** Share only with people
> you trust; do not use in production.

You're testing the **unified `azure.yaml`**: you describe a whole Foundry project
— the project, model deployments, connections, toolboxes, skills, agents, and
routines — as `services:` entries in **one file**, then drive it with the azd
commands you already know (`azd ai agent init`, `azd up`, `azd down`). No more
`agent.yaml` / `agent.manifest.yaml`.

This guide is a checklist: each section is **a thing to try**, the **exact
command**, and **what you should see**. Items marked **(no Azure)** need only the
editor / CLI; the rest need an Azure subscription + Foundry access. Pick any —
they're independent.

## Setup (three steps)

### 0. Clone this repo

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/huimiu/azd-foundry-extension-bugbash
cd azd-foundry-extension-bugbash
```
### 1. Put azd on PATH

```powershell
cd azd-foundry-core
$env:PATH = "$PWD;$env:PATH"   # this shell only; or add the folder to PATH permanently
azd version                    # -> 1.27.0-beta.1-pr.foundrytest3
cd ..
```

If SmartScreen warns about an unknown publisher: **More info → Run anyway**.

### 2. Install the extensions

```powershell
.\foundry-registry\install-foundry.ps1
azd extension list
```

> 🔁 **Refreshing from an earlier build?** If you already installed these
> extensions, run `azd extension uninstall microsoft.foundry` first, then re-run
> the install script. azd treats the `-foundrytest.N` suffix as the same version,
> so it won't replace an already-installed binary otherwise.

✅ **Expect:** every `azure.ai.*` + `microsoft.foundry` shows a `*-foundrytest.*`
version with source `foundrytest` (`azure.ai.agents` is `foundrytest.4`, the rest
`foundrytest.1`).

## Try it

### 1. Scaffold a project (no Azure)

Make a fresh directory **outside this repo** — anywhere *not* nested under a
folder that already contains an `azure.yaml` (azd discovers projects by walking
**up** the tree, so running it inside `unified-yaml-sample/` would add the agent
to that project instead of making a new one).

```powershell
mkdir my-foundry-app; cd my-foundry-app
azd ai agent init
```

✅ **Expect:** one `azure.yaml` with `services:` entries (a `host: azure.ai.project`
service and a `host: azure.ai.agent` service) plus the agent source. **No**
`agent.yaml`, **no** `agent.manifest.yaml`, and **no** `infra/` folder (Bicep-less
by default).

### 2. See it validate in the editor (no Azure)

Open [`unified-yaml-sample/azure.yaml`](./unified-yaml-sample/azure.yaml) in
**VS Code** (with the YAML extension).

✅ **Expect:** the `# yaml-language-server: $schema=…` line resolves; you get
autocomplete on `host:` values and inside `deployments:` / the agent fields.
Now break it — misspell `host: azure.ai.projct`, move `deployments:` under the
agent, or add an unknown field — and **expect red squiggles**.

### 3. Provision & deploy (needs Azure)

> **`unified-yaml-sample/`** contains a minimal `azure.yaml` (one project + one agent)
> and a stub agent under `src/assistant/`. It deploys successfully and exercises the
> full orchestration pipeline, but the agent itself does nothing at runtime.
>
> **To test with a real, runnable agent instead**, run `azd ai agent sample` in a new
> directory outside this repo and pick a sample — it scaffolds a working agent plus a
> unified `azure.yaml`. Then follow the same steps below in that directory.
> Browse available samples at [aka.ms/foundry-agents-samples](https://aka.ms/foundry-agents-samples).

```powershell
cd unified-yaml-sample
azd auth login
azd env new foundry-bugbash
azd up
```

✅ **Expect:** azd walks the services in `uses:` order — it **provisions the
project + model deployment first**, then **deploys the agent** — and shows
**progress per service**, not one opaque step. On success it prints the project /
agent endpoint. (`azd up` = `azd provision` + `azd deploy`; you can run them
separately.)

### 4. Re-run safely (needs Azure)

```powershell
azd deploy
```

✅ **Expect:** running deploy again **upserts** — finished work is reconciled, not
duplicated.

### 5. Watch failure attribution (needs Azure)

Edit `ai-project`'s deployment to a bad `model.version`, then:

```powershell
azd provision
```

✅ **Expect:** the error **names the failing service** (`ai-project`) and stops
downstream work — the agent isn't deployed against a broken project.

### 6. Reuse an existing project (needs Azure)

Add an `endpoint:` to the `ai-project` service in `azure.yaml`:

```yaml
  ai-project:
    host: azure.ai.project
    endpoint: ${FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}   # set it in .azure/<env>/.env
```

```powershell
azd provision
```

✅ **Expect:** the **presence of `endpoint:`** makes azd **connect to the existing
project and skip ARM provisioning**; `azd deploy` only reconciles data-plane state
and pushes agents. Later, `azd down` must **not** delete an `endpoint:`-based
project.

### 7. Add more resources (needs Azure)

A toolbox, connection, skill, routine, or second agent is just **another
`services:` entry**. Copy one from the fully-wired
[`complex.azure.yaml`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/blob/huimiu/foundry-azure-yaml/cli/azd/extensions/azure.ai.agents/schemas/examples/complex.azure.yaml)
into your `azure.yaml`, wire it with `uses:`, then:

```powershell
azd deploy
```

✅ **Expect:** each new service gets **its own progress line** and reconciles in
`uses:` order (connections/toolboxes/skills before the agents that use them). One
toolbox can be shared by **multiple agents** — something the old per-agent
`agent.manifest.yaml` couldn't do. You can also drive each resource from its CLI:
`azd ai connection`, `azd ai toolbox`, `azd ai skill`, `azd ai routine`,
`azd ai agent`.

### 8. Init without Bicep, or with Terraform / a prebuilt image (no Azure)

```powershell
azd ai agent init                              # Bicep-less: no infra/ folder
azd ai agent init --infra terraform            # scaffold Terraform instead
azd ai agent init --image <registry/image:tag> # use a prebuilt image, skip the build
```

✅ **Expect:** a Foundry-only project scaffolds with **no `infra/` folder**;
`--infra terraform` writes a `.tf` module; `--image` **skips the source build** at
deploy.

### 9. Split a file with `$ref` (no Azure)

Move a service body into its own file and reference it; keys next to `$ref`
override the loaded file:

```yaml
services:
  assistant:
    host: azure.ai.agent
    uses: [ai-project]
    $ref: ./agents/assistant.yaml             # body loaded from the file
    description: Overrides the file's description.   # sibling override wins
```

✅ **Expect:** the body loads from the file, the sibling `description:` **overrides**
it, relative paths inside the file (`project:`, `instructions:`) **rebase to that
file's folder**, and a bad/unreadable path gives a **clear error**. `$ref` also
works for deployments, skills, and agents (see `complex.azure.yaml`).

### 10. Turn on private networking (needs Azure)

Add a `network:` block to the `azure.ai.project` service (omit it for a public
account):

```yaml
  ai-project:
    host: azure.ai.project
    network:
      agentSubnet: { vnet: ${AZURE_VNET_ID}, name: agent-subnet, prefix: 192.168.0.0/24 }
      peSubnet:    { vnet: ${AZURE_VNET_ID}, name: pe-subnet,    prefix: 192.168.1.0/24 }
    deployments:
      - name: gpt-4o-mini
        model: { format: OpenAI, name: gpt-4o-mini, version: "2024-07-18" }
        sku:   { name: GlobalStandard, capacity: 10 }
```

```powershell
azd provision
```

✅ **Expect:** a **VNet-bound, network-secured account with public access
disabled**. (Omit `agentSubnet` to use the Microsoft-managed network.) More detail
in the agents extension's `docs/private-networking.md`.

### 11. Tear it all down (needs Azure)

```powershell
azd down
```

✅ **Expect:** azd removes what **it** provisioned (project + deployments +
agents). A project you brought via `endpoint:` is **left untouched**.
